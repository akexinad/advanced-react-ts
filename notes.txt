WHAT IS REACT
=============

React is basically is JS library for building User Interfaces.



COMPONENT LIFECYCLES
====================

NOTE: Lifecycle hooks have nothing to do with React hooks.

Below is a list of the class lifecycle hooks in execution order.


CONSTRUCTOR
===========

The first to invoke.

If you create your own constructor where you have to create your own logic then you have to call super(props).

DO NOT CAUSE SIDE EFFECTS. Example. Do not make HTTP requests or store data in local storage.


GET DERIVED STATE FROM PROPS
============================

Whenever your props change, you can sync your state to the changes.

This will be used very very rarely.

AGAIN, DO NOT CAUSE SIDE EFFECTS.


RENDER
======

We all know this one.

This is where you prepare and structure your JSX code.


RENDER CHILD COMPONENTS
=======================

All the components declared in the render() function above will then be invoked.


COMPONENT DID MOUNT
===================

This is a very important hook.

HERE YOU CAUSE SIDE-EFFECTS (Http requests).

You should not call setState in this hook UNLESS it is done within the .then block of a promise.
